# Cash Position Forecast

**See your cash month by month, including the floor.**

## What it does

Ask your AI assistant to project your cash forward, and it returns your real settled month-end balances followed by a worst-case projection — the same series the Well app charts. The projection assumes no incoming revenue, so it is a floor rather than a prediction, and the answer says so every time rather than letting you mistake one for the other.

## Required data in Well

- **Banking connector** — *required.* The forecast is built from your real month-end balance history, so this is what makes it possible.

## Composes onto

This skill delegates two setup steps to Well's atomic skills rather than repeating them:

- **[`define-workspace`](define-workspace.md)** — pins which Well workspace the answer is for.
- **[`connect-tools`](connect-tools.md)** — checks which of your bank / accounting / invoicing sources are connected.

Install both alongside this one. The skill still runs without them — each step falls back to resolving things inline — but with them installed you get one consistent workspace and connection flow across every Well skill. The **Claude Code plugin** and **Codex plugin** paths below install all three together; if you download the `.skill` file on its own, grab those two as well.

## Installation

### AI Assisted (Recommended)

Paste this into any AI agent — Claude, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, and others:

> [!NOTE]
> We suggest using **Claude Chat** rather than Claude Cowork for this step — Cowork's approach is noticeably slower and pricier for a quick install like this. Any Claude model works fine.

```
Install the following official skills from Well.

**Instructions**:

1. Fetch these files:
    a. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WellApp-ai/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/cash-forecast/SKILL.md
    b. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WellApp-ai/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/define-workspace/SKILL.md
    c. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WellApp-ai/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/connect-tools/SKILL.md
2. Download and display these files to the user. The file name must be "SKILL.md". No prefix, no suffix. Exact name as specified.
3. Install these skills.
4. Before replying to the user, ensure you have named the downloaded files "SKILL.md". This is crucial for the rest of the steps.
5. If the MCP https://api.wellapp.ai/v1/mcp is not installed: suggest it to the user and explain how to add a new MCP.
```
