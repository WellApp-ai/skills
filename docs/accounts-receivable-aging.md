# Accounts Receivable Aging

**See who owes you money, and how long they've been sitting on it.**

## What it does

Chasing down late payments starts with knowing who's late. Ask your AI assistant who owes you money, and it pulls the answer straight from your synced invoices — every unpaid or partially-paid customer invoice, sorted into aging buckets (current, 1-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+ days overdue) — with real currency amounts and an as-of date attached, not a guess.

## Required data in Well

- **Invoicing / accounting connector** — *required.* This is where your issued customer invoices and their payment status come from.
- **Company profile confirmed in Well** — *required.* The skill needs to know which company is yours so it can tell receivables (what customers owe you) apart from payables (what you owe others).

## Composes onto

This skill delegates two setup steps to Well's atomic skills rather than repeating them:

- **[`define-workspace`](define-workspace.md)** — pins which Well workspace the answer is for.
- **[`connect-tools`](connect-tools.md)** — checks which of your bank / accounting / invoicing sources are connected.

Install both alongside this one. The skill still runs without them — each step falls back to resolving things inline — but with them installed you get one consistent workspace and connection flow across every Well skill. The **Claude Code plugin** and **Codex plugin** paths below install all three together; if you download the `.skill` file on its own, grab those two as well.

## Installation

### AI Assisted (Recommended)

Paste this into any AI agent — Claude, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, and others:

> [!NOTE]
> We suggest using **Claude Chat** rather than Claude Cowork for this step — Cowork's approach is noticeably slower and pricier for a quick install like this. Any Claude model works fine.

```
Install the following official skills from Well.

**Instructions**:

1. Fetch these files:
    a. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WellApp-ai/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/accounts-receivable-aging/SKILL.md
    b. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WellApp-ai/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/define-workspace/SKILL.md
    c. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WellApp-ai/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/connect-tools/SKILL.md
2. Download and display these files to the user. The file name must be "SKILL.md". No prefix, no suffix. Exact name as specified.
3. Install these skills.
4. Before replying to the user, ensure you have named the downloaded files "SKILL.md". This is crucial for the rest of the steps.
5. If the MCP https://api.wellapp.ai/v1/mcp is not installed: suggest it to the user and explain how to add a new MCP.
