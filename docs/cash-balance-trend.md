# Cash Balance Trend

**See whether your cash is going up or down — as a real history, not a guess.**

## What it does

Ask your AI assistant "is our cash going up or down?" and it pulls your real, synced bank balances over time — not a single snapshot, and never a forecast — and shows you exactly how your cash has moved: the dates, the balances, the currency, and the direction. If you want to know what's coming next, that's a different question (see the runway skill); this one only tells you what already happened.

## Required data in Well

- **Banking connector** — *required.* This is where your real historical cash balances come from.
- **More than one synced balance period per account** — *required for a trend.* A freshly connected account with only one snapshot has nothing to trend yet; the skill will say so plainly instead of guessing a direction.

## Composes onto

This skill delegates three setup steps to Well's atomic skills rather than repeating them:

- **[`define-workspace`](define-workspace.md)** — pins which Well workspace the answer is for.
- **[`connect-tools`](connect-tools.md)** — checks which of your bank / accounting / invoicing sources are connected.
- **[`normalize-currency`](normalize-currency.md)** — turns amounts in several currencies into one total with its rate and date, so a single-total view carries the rate and date behind it.

Install all three alongside this one. The skill still runs without them — each step falls back to resolving things inline — but with them installed you get one consistent workspace and connection flow across every Well skill. The **Claude Code plugin** and **Codex plugin** paths below install all four together; if you download the `.skill` file on its own, grab those three as well.

## Installation

### AI Assisted (Recommended)

Paste this into any AI agent — Claude, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, and others:

> [!NOTE]
> We suggest using **Claude Chat** rather than Claude Cowork for this step — Cowork's approach is noticeably slower and pricier for a quick install like this. Any Claude model works fine.

```
Install the following official skills from Well.

**Instructions**:

1. Fetch these files:
    a. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WellApp-ai/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/cash-balance-trend/SKILL.md
    b. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WellApp-ai/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/define-workspace/SKILL.md
    c. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WellApp-ai/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/connect-tools/SKILL.md
    d. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WellApp-ai/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/normalize-currency/SKILL.md
2. Download and display these files to the user. The file name must be "SKILL.md". No prefix, no suffix. Exact name as specified.
3. Install these skills.
4. Before replying to the user, ensure you have named the downloaded files "SKILL.md". This is crucial for the rest of the steps.
5. If the MCP https://api.wellapp.ai/v1/mcp is not installed: suggest it to the user and explain how to add a new MCP.
