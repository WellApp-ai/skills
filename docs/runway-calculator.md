# Runway Calculator

**Know exactly how many months and days of cash you have left.**

## What it does

Nobody should have to build a spreadsheet just to answer "how much runway do we have?" This skill checks your real bank balances against what you've actually been spending, and gives you a plain answer — in months *and* days — plus the exact math behind it, so you can trust the number or double-check it yourself.

## Required data in Well

- **Banking connector** — *required.* This is where your real cash balance comes from.
- **Accounting connector or bank transaction history** — *required.* This is how the skill works out your burn rate (how fast you're spending).

## Composes onto

This skill delegates two setup steps to Well's atomic skills rather than repeating them:

- **[`define-workspace`](define-workspace.md)** — pins which Well workspace the answer is for.
- **[`connect-tools`](connect-tools.md)** — checks which of your bank / accounting / invoicing sources are connected.

Install both alongside this one. The skill still runs without them — each step falls back to resolving things inline — but with them installed you get one consistent workspace and connection flow across every Well skill. The **Claude Code plugin** and **Codex plugin** paths below install all three together; if you download the `.skill` file on its own, grab those two as well.

## Installation

### AI Assisted (Recommended)

Paste this into any AI agent — Claude, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, and others:

> [!NOTE]
> We suggest using **Claude Chat** rather than Claude Cowork for this step — Cowork's approach is noticeably slower and pricier for a quick install like this. Any Claude model works fine.

```
Install the following official skills from Well.

**Instructions**:

1. Fetch these files:
    a. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WellApp-ai/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/runway-calculator/SKILL.md
    b. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WellApp-ai/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/define-workspace/SKILL.md
    c. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WellApp-ai/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/connect-tools/SKILL.md
2. Download and display these files to the user. The file name must be "SKILL.md". No prefix, no suffix. Exact name as specified.
3. Install these skills.
4. Before replying to the user, ensure you have named the downloaded files "SKILL.md". This is crucial for the rest of the steps.
5. If the MCP https://api.wellapp.ai/v1/mcp is not installed: suggest it to the user and explain how to add a new MCP.
